# Portfolio-site
Welcome to my Portfolio

This portfolio is home to all of my professional and some of my personal projects, it also houses my contact information and resume. I built this Portfolio 
to make it much easier for people who I have a personal or professional relationship with to view my work, it is a pain to have everything in different places and have to find it when asked
this way evrything can be found in one place.

# Technologies used and Approach 

I made this portfolio with a combonation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to make it as easy to use as possible because everybody hates being confused
when looking on the web. There are a few JavaScript additions to hopefully make the use of this app fun and also easier. 

# Carousel

This is where my projects are stored using a carousel. each dot at the bottom represents a different project! by clicking the dot you will be brought to a new project.
if you want to go back, just click the dot you left!

# Selecting a project

Once you find a project you want to view just hover your mouse over the picture! a description will pop up with the projects Information and links to individual
code if you fancy reading some code.

# Buttons
Last but certainly not least are the buttons at the bottom of the page!

If code doesn’t interest you in the slightest and you just want more imformation about me, this is what you came for. 
there are two links that go directly to my personal Facebook and the other my LinkedIn 

The middle button wont exactly take you away from my portfolio but it will open up my resume! 
After you’re done checking that out maybe you’ll stick around to play on some of my personal projects!
